# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I like it. It seems much faster and argubably more intuitve than Java, and seems like it does more of the work for you. 


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Java requires more attention to detail, python does stuff "for you". The indenting is weird, I haven't ever seen that in another programming language.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

math is much easier to do without needing to define datatypes. Also, python runs really quickly!
